Bug: image header?
TEST: goisforlovers.md (in /content)

There is a image input that isn't working for the page 
- it should be something that sits in the header?
- it should be posted as the reference image for the post? (or maybe don't bother)

Tweaks:
- colors (of the overall theme)
- logo
- the fonts are gross.
- links to my other sites : linkedIn , github,
- need to fix the LICENSE - its MIT - but I pulled between two different authors.
- will probably need to create a new testsite that TESTS EVERYTHING

TEST EVERYTHING
- (remove the french site)
- aka. how to add images
- the youtube shortcode
- the gallery shortcode
